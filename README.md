# Machine Learning Course
A workspace of my assignments for Coursera's Machine Learning course.  I am using this repository as a method of tracking my progress and development through this course.    
**NOTE:  I do not claim to be the sole author of all the code posted.  Some is provided by the course in order to provide a framework from which to work.  The code written by me will be clearly denoted as such.**  
## Ex-1
  The first coding exercise was assigned in Week 2 of the course.  It covers Linear Regression and Gradient Descent as they apply to Machine Learning.  This section also taught Octave and how to optimally make these calculations using the language.
